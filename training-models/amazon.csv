479,0,I'd like to return it.
480,1,The keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough I don't expect any problems.
481,0,"Verizon's bills, however, are difficult to understand even though their pricing plans are simple."
482,1,"After charging overnight, these batteries work great."
483,1,You won't regret it!
484,1,I love this phone!.
485,0,A Disappointment.

492,1,"I would definitely recommend the Jabra BT250v for those who are looking for comfort, clarity and a great price!"

533,0,So I basically threw my money out the window for nothing.
534,1,Great case and price!
535,0,All it took was one drop from about 6 inches above the kitchen counter and it was cracked.I am not impressed and I am not laughing.

588,0,"I only used it two days, and it wasn't always easy to hear with."
589,0,I got the car charger and not even after a week the charger was broken...I went to plug it in and it started smoking.

608,0,"It is cheap, and it feel and look just as cheap."
609,1,It fits my ear well and is comfortable on.
610,0,It doesn't work in Europe or Asia.
611,1,clipping this to your belt will deffinitely make you feel like 50 cent's up-and-coming.
612,1,I like design and look of Jabra behing the ear headsets and 5020 is pretty comfortible to wear 24 hours a day without pain in the ear.
613,1,I was amazed at the quick arrival of the two original lg cell phone batteries and and at a fraction of the price.
614,0,the worst phone from samsung...crap..... this crappy Samsung E715.. is the worst i have ever seeen.
615,0,the charger worked for about a week and then completely stopped charging my phone.
616,0,Poor product.
617,0,However I needed some better instructions.
618,0,You need two hands to operate the screen.This software interface is decade old and cannot compete with new software designs.

635,1,im surprised this is a good quality car charger and there's not much reviews about it.
636,1,These are fabulous!
637,0,"However, BT headsets are currently not good for real time games like first-person shooters since the audio delay messes me up."

654,0,"The charger arrived within the promised timeframe, but it did not work."
655,1,"No ear loop needed, it's tiny and the sound is great."
656,0,"Finally, after three or four times the spring of the latch broke and I could not use it any longer on the visor."
657,1,"The handsfree part works fine, but then the car tries to download the address book, and the Treo reboots.Overall, I still rate this device high."
658,0,Talk about USELESS customer service.
659,0,"It felt too light and ""tinny.""."

668,1,Much less than the jawbone I was going to replace it with.
669,1,Setup went very smoothly.
670,0,its extremely slow and takes forever to do anything with it.
671,0,"A must study for anyone interested in the ""worst sins"" of industrial design."
672,0,The first thing that happened was that the tracking was off.
673,1,"It is well made, easy to access the phone and has a handy, detachable belt clip."
674,0,Then I had to continue pairing it periodically since it somehow kept dropping.
675,0,Can't upload ringtones from a third party.
676,0,"Bluetooth does not work, phone locks up, screens just flash up and now it just makes calls randomly while in my pocket locked."
677,0,Truly awful.
678,1,"It works fine on my Motorola 325 cellphone, and a lot better than the worn-out battery did."
679,1,The volume for the ringer is REAL good (you have choices how loud).
680,0,And none of the tones is acceptable.
681,0,camera color balance is AWFUL.
682,0,"This product is clearly not ready for prime time, I don't care how cool it looks, if you can't tell a call is coming in it's worthless."

693,0,"The biggest complaint I have is, the battery drains superfast."
694,0,The design might be ergonomic in theory but I could not stand having these in my ear.
695,0,Do NOT buy if you want to use the holster.
696,1,The phone can also take great pictures and even video clips.
697,0,It doesn't make you look cool.
698,1,"Because both ears are occupied, background is not distracting at all."
699,1,"Comfortable fit - you need your headset to be comfortable for at least an hour at a time, if not for an entire day."
700,0,"Also, the phone doesn't seem to accept anything except CBR mp3s, preferably ripped by Windows Media Player."
701,1,You can't beat the price on these.
702,1,"* Comes with a strong light that you can use to light up your camera shots, and even flash SOS signals (seriously!"
703,1,lightweight and works well.
704,0,So just beware.
705,1,I love this cable - it allows me to connect any mini-USB device to my PC.
706,0,So anyone near you will hear part of your conversation.
707,1,This is cool because most cases are just open there allowing the screen to get all scratched up.

718,1,It was a great phone.
719,0,if you simply want a small flip phone -- look elsewhere as the extra bells & whistles are mediocre.
720,1,"Good value, works fine - power via USB, car, or wall outlet."
721,1,My phone doesn't slide around my car now and the grip prevents my phone from slipping out of my hand.
722,1,This is simply the BEST bluetooth headset for sound quality!
723,0,Think it over when you plan to own this one!This sure is the last MOTO phone for me!
724,1,"In the span of an hour, I had two people exclaim ""Whoa - is that the new phone on TV?!?"

730,1,This product is great... it makes working a lot easier I can go to the copier while waiting on hold for something.
731,0,None of the three sizes they sent with the headset would stay in my ears.
732,1,T-Mobile has the best customer service anywhere.
